# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-01-26

### CLI
- Added `cax auto` to run Mash-based auto-selection and execute without launching the UI; supports `--seqfile` for a short-form input and enforces Mash presence in auto mode.
- Auto mode now refreshes the cached preprocess seq file before Mash so cached local inputs are honored when URLs were downloaded.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-24

### Mash auto-selection
- Added tree-aware pairwise Mash distance evaluation with early-stop pruning ("prove > threshold") and persistent caching under `<out_dir>/logs/` to avoid recomputation across repeated runs.
- PlanUI: threshold modal (`T`) recomputes and reselects rounds; tree labels show `Mash:…@source` when the displayed distance originates from a descendant witness/max to avoid misinterpretation.
- CLI: optional prompt before computing Mash distances (includes leaf / max-pairs estimate) and stronger warning when `mash` is missing; supports caching remote sequences up front so Mash can run locally.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-14

### UI
- Run Settings now has a dual-view toggle (`F6`): switch between the classic plan overview and a new flow view that renders the execution dependency tree as ASCII, so you can see round ordering and ancestry while editing thread/verbose options.
- When an existing `logs/run_state.json` is detected and you keep the output directories, PlanUI opens directly into a dedicated resume view (inside Run Settings) that shows completed/pending steps and the next command to run.
- Added an explicit Subtree Mode toggle (CAX-only sentinel, not passed to ramax): enabling it on a node forces RaMAx for that subtree and automatically disables RaMAx on descendants; switching back to node mode removes the sentinel. Child-level edits now auto-cancel an ancestor’s subtree mode to avoid conflicts (with safe handling when no Textual app is active).

### Fixes
- Safeguard subtree-mode reversion when no Textual app context exists (tests/CLI), preventing NoActiveAppError during node-level toggles.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-25

### UI
- Rebuilt the alignment browser as an ASCII phylogenetic canvas with proportional branch spacing, inline RaMAx/cactus colouring, and in-place repainting without the old Textual tree widget.
- Added scope switching between subtree and single-node toggles (key `b`), plus bulk-revert safeguards with modal hints so mixed cactus/RaMAx edits stay consistent.
- Added search (`/`, `n` / `Shift+N`), dotted branch-length annotations, ASCII glyph fallback, and a detail buffer/info modal so large trees stay navigable and summaries remain visible even on narrow terminals.
- Introduced a bottom Dashboard HUD that mirrors the current node, subtree/total RaMAx coverage, and live CPU/GPU/memory/disk metrics; keeps summaries readable on narrow terminals.
- Display a short welcome/quick-start overlay after mount to highlight navigation, toggles, and run flow for new users.

### Planner
- Skip RaMAx rounds whose ancestors already run with RaMAx, while still honoring cactus overrides inside those subtrees so users can mix modes intentionally.
- Suppress `halAppendSubtree` merges when the parent round output was produced by RaMAx, preventing redundant HAL writes.

### Tree parsing
- Alignment nodes now retain branch lengths, support values, and parent links, enabling proportional layouts and state colouring while tolerating unlabeled or missing edges.
- Newick parsing accepts numeric internal labels as support scores and ignores malformed branch lengths instead of failing the entire parse.

### CLI & plumbing
- Moved the plan overview/environment rendering helpers into `cax.ui` (retiring `cax.render`) and pointed CLI previews at the shared UI renderer for consistent output and script exports.

### Tests
- Added coverage for RaMAx ancestor/descendant overrides in the planner and for bulk RaMAx subtree reversion when toggling individual nodes in the UI.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-11-08

### UI
- The cactus-prepare wizard now lives inside a full-height scroll container with a dedicated footer so form fields remain focusable while actions stay pinned, even in narrow or short terminals.
- Instructions switch between compact and detailed copy, and resize-driven layout classes collapse spacing and stack buttons when needed to keep the wizard readable at any screen size.
- Pressing `R` now switches to a dedicated Run Settings screen that gathers verbose/log streaming and the shared cactus/RaMAx thread count in one place before execution, removing the in-plan toggles.
- The Run Settings screen shows a live plan summary next to the form, updates instantly as you toggle verbose or edit the thread count, and exposes keyboard hints (`Tab`, `Ctrl+Enter`, `V`) so the entire flow can be driven without the mouse. All instructional text has been converted to English for consistency.

### CLI & Planner
- `cax ui` still accepts `--threads N`, but the value now seeds the Run Settings dialog (or the post-UI prompt when `--run-after` is used) instead of bloating the plan definition; the planner applies `--maxCores/--threads` overrides only at execution time.
- Plan serialization drops the `verbose`/`thread_count` fields, keeping plan files focused on cactus/RaMAx steps while run-only options live alongside the executor.

### Runner
- Enhanced the quiet-mode progress bar with wait time, CPU utilization, memory usage, and peak memory columns, while printing the full command in a separate line so the bar stays readable on narrow terminals.
- Added a psutil-backed telemetry thread that periodically aggregates CPU and memory stats from the running command and its descendants, synchronizing the metrics on dry-run skips, failures, and successful completions.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-11-07

### Highlights
- The Textual `cactus-prepare` prompt now features an argument wizard (F2 / `:wizard`), template chooser (F3 / `:template`), and history window (F4 / `!N`), guiding newcomers through common flags, bundling Evolver examples, and reusing the 20 most recent commands to shorten onboarding.
- The CLI persists each command, infers the real output directory from `--outDir` or `--outSeqFile`, and writes `cax_prepare_debug.txt` into that directory so logs travel alongside their artifacts.

### CLI & Prompt
- Added inline shortcut hints plus `!N` history recall and the `:wizard`/`:template` quick commands, reducing re-typing and accidental edits.
- The wizard separates the species tree, outputs, HAL target, job store, and extra arguments; the extra field honors `shlex` parsing, and defaults are inferred from the current command or a chosen template.
- Before running `cactus-prepare`, the CLI records the exact command in `~/.cax/history.json` and emits debug output next to the inferred outputs (defaulting to `steps-output/`), keeping history, logs, and artifacts aligned.

### Templates & Examples
- Introduced a template manager that scans the packaged Evolver Newick samples together with user entries in `~/.cax/templates.json`, deduplicates them, and points defaults to `~/.cax/outputs/<stem>` so repeated runs do not collide.
- Wheel builds now ship the Evolver example files, so templates work immediately after installation without manual copies.

### History
- Added a lightweight history store (max 20 entries) in `~/.cax/history.json`, including the ability to delete entries from the history window and reuse them across projects.

### UI
- Plan Overview supports a compact mode below 110 columns, hiding the environment card and tightening columns to avoid overflow, while environment summaries and RaMAx option dialogs now use English copy.
- The command editor switched to a multi-line TextArea with `Ctrl+S` save support, making long commands easier to edit and presenting modal text in English for clarity.
- The environment summary card condenses multi-line paths and versions into single-line snippets, uses English labels, and stays readable at any terminal width.

### Other
- `.gitignore` now ignores `*.pyc` to avoid accidentally committing Python bytecode.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-28

### Highlights
- Added interactive confirmation before running `cactus-prepare`, allowing users to remove stale `--outDir`/`--jobStore` directories in advance.
- Enhanced execution feedback with Rich-based progress indicators, end-of-run summaries, and optional verbose streaming of all command output.
- Surfaced plan-level verbose state in the UI (toggle with `V`) and overview rendering, keeping the terminal quiet by default while filtering RaMAx graph verification noise.

### UI
- Added Environment Summary card to the top of the details pane, showing RaMAx/cactus paths and versions, GPU, CPU, memory, and disk. The card is now rendered as a Rich `Panel` and adapts to terminal width to avoid overflow and misalignment.
- Replaced fixed-width string rendering with Rich renderables (`Panel`, `Table`) for both the Environment Summary and Plan Overview, ensuring responsive layout from narrow to full-screen terminals.
- Introduced RaMAx options editor: global `plan.global_ramax_opts` and per-round `round.ramax_opts` editable via a new modal with add/remove controls. Options are reflected in command previews automatically.
- Removed unsupported `gap` CSS usage and adjusted spacing with margins to fix Textual CSS errors.

### Detection & Tooling
- Environment detection now reports cactus (not cactus-prepare) path and version. Cactus version is obtained via `pip show cactus | grep -i ^Version` with a fallback to `python -m pip show cactus` parsing; noisy NVML messages are filtered out.
- Minor CLI polish: removed echoing of the full `cactus-prepare` command to reduce console noise.

### Documentation & Tooling
- Updated README with the new verbose shortcut and pre-run cleanup behaviour.
- Expanded `PlanRunner` logging to emphasise failures and log locations.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-25

The inaugural release of Cactus-RaMAx introduces an interactive workflow for remixing `cactus-prepare` plans with RaMAx substitutions.

### Highlights
- Tree-aware editor that visualises the cactus progressive alignment hierarchy and supports toggling RaMAx across entire subtrees with a single keystroke.
- Execution planner that automatically suppresses cactus rounds and `halAppendSubtree` steps inside RaMAx-controlled subtrees, eliminating duplicate merges and related HAL errors.

### Documentation & Tooling
- Added this changelog to document future releases.
- Refreshed the quick-start guide and in-app messaging to match the new workflow.
- Captured the canonical project version in the new `VERSION` file.
